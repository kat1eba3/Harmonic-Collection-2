    <p>My theme for the harmonic collection focuses on my daily commute to school. Commuting is a big part of my school year, as I spend quite some time sitting on the bus and the train. The task of commuting quickly becomes mundane with the same scenery and route day after day. A big part of my commute involves music, as it helps going from place to place become less boring and, at times, more exciting. I want my theme to combine commuting and music to illustrate a romanticized, fun take on my daily commute. For this reimagined version of commuting, I want to do a scrapbook like layout and incorporate mixed media art composed of photographs of the places I sit, walk, and see as I head to school or home, combining it with my own illustrations and writings to create a visual and narrative representation of my daily journey. Through the scattered combination of images, writing, drawings, and music I plan to convey the essence of my commute, transforming it into a creative and captivating experience. </p>
